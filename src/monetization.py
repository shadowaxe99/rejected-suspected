```python
class SubscriptionPlan:
    def __init__(self, name, price, features):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price
        self.features = features

class Monetization:
    def __init__(self):
        self.plans = []
        self.create_plans()

    def create_plans(self):
        free_plan = SubscriptionPlan("Free", 0, ["Basic sarcasm detection"])
        paid_plan = SubscriptionPlan("Premium", 9.99, ["Context-aware analysis", "Sentiment detection"])
        enterprise_plan = SubscriptionPlan("Enterprise", None, ["API usage"])

        self.plans.extend([free_plan, paid_plan, enterprise_plan])

    def get_plan(self, plan_name):
        for plan in self.plans:
            if plan.name.lower() == plan_name.lower():
                return plan
        return None

    def calculate_enterprise_plan(self, api_requests):
        # Pricing model: $0.01 per API request
        return api_requests * 0.01
```
This Python code defines a `SubscriptionPlan` class to represent different subscription plans and a `Monetization` class to manage these plans. The `Monetization` class includes methods to create the plans, get a specific plan, and calculate the cost of the enterprise plan based on the number of API requests.
